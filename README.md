# Clipboard Health Sales Strategy Recommendations
## Introduction
The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services publish a quarterly report containing daily staffing data for all registered nursing homes in the U.S. This dataset is called Payroll Based Journal (PBJ) Daily Nurse Staffing
## Goal
Analyze the PBJ data and any other CMS data that could be see fit to make a few recommendations to the Clipboard Health sales leadership team
## Technologoies
- Jupyter lab
- Python
- libraries: Seaborn, Pandas, Matplotlib,

## Recommendation 1: Leverage High Staffing Demand in New York City

### Observation
While Ohio (OH) has the largest number of nursing facilities, New York City (NYC) exhibits the highest staffing demand in terms of total hours worked. NYC facilities also have higher average occupancy rates, indicating greater staff utilization. Although Ohio leads in facility numbers, individual facilities in NYC require more staffing hours and operate at higher capacity. Notably, 8 of the top 10 facilities by total working hours are located in NYC, highlighting significant staffing needs.

### Recommendation
Focus sales efforts on densely populated regions like NYC, where the need for temporary staffing is highest due to staffing demands and high occupancy rates. The Clipboard Health app can quickly address staffing shortages, allowing facilities to maintain high-quality care during peak demand periods and meet regulatory requirements.

### Market Focus
Target high-demand regions like NYC, focusing on facilities with high occupancy rates and recurring staffing shortages. These facilities require flexible, fast-response staffing solutions to manage their ongoing challenges.

## Recommendation 2: Promote the App during Peak Bed Utilization Periods

### Observation
During the first two weeks of January, data reveals a steady increase in active beds (MDScensus), indicating a surge in patient occupancy across facilities. This trend likely corresponds to seasonal peaks in healthcare demand. Notably, there is a drop in utilization on weekends.

### Recommendation
Promote the app as a high-availability staffing solution that provides reliable, on-demand support during periods of increased patient occupancy. Emphasize the app's ability to deliver dependable staff quickly, ensuring facilities can handle surges in occupancy without compromising care quality.

### Market Focus
Target facilities that experience seasonal surges, emphasizing the app’s ability to ensure a steady flow of qualified staff, reducing the risk of understaffing during peak times.

## Recommendation 3: Market the App as a Real-Time Staffing Optimization Tool

### Observation
Nursing facilities often struggle to balance Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), Registered Nurses (RNs), and Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs). Overstaffing leads to unnecessary costs, while understaffing compromises patient care. Shortages arise when resident demand spikes between 500 and 700 residents.

### Recommendation
Promote the app as a real-time staffing optimization tool, enabling facilities to monitor and adjust staffing levels dynamically. The app’s flexibility allows quick responses to demand changes, helping reduce overstaffing risks and improve efficiency.

### Market Focus
Focus on nursing facilities with staffing imbalances, particularly during high-demand periods where resident census spikes. Emphasize the app’s capability to optimize workforce ratios in real-time, minimizing costs and improving care outcomes.

## Recommendation 4: Prioritize CNA and LPN Recruitment to Meet Demand Peak

### Observation
Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) account for over 55.4% of total working hours, making them the most significant staffing target. Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) have the second-highest demand. Both roles are critical to maintaining smooth operations, especially during peak periods.

### Recommendation
Focus on recruiting and onboarding more CNAs as the primary staffing target. Ensure a steady supply of LPNs to meet the growing demand in nursing facilities. Prioritize availability during peak periods to maintain high-quality care.

### Market Focus
1. **Target Facilities with High CNA Demand**: Emphasize the consistent supply of CNAs to avoid staffing shortages.
2. **Position LPNs as the Second Priority**: Highlight the app's flexibility to meet both CNA and LPN staffing needs.

## Recommendation 5: Position Contractors as Complementary to Full-Time Employees

### Observation
Contractor hours remain steady while employee hours fluctuate, indicating contractors are not merely substitutes for full-time employees but fill different roles. Contractors provide consistent support, especially in times of high or low demand.

### Recommendation
Position the app as a supportive tool for facilities. Emphasize that contractors are essential complements, not substitutes, to full-time staff. Highlight the app's role in helping facilities maintain a steady level of care without solely relying on full-time employees.

### Market Focus
Convey that using contractors allows healthcare facilities to navigate staffing challenges effectively, manage unexpected surges, or cover for regular staff during absences.

## Recommendation 6: Targeted Marketing Based on Facility Ownership and Tenure

### Observation
Analysis from the "NH_Ownership_Sep2024" dataset indicates organization-owned and individual-owned facilities have similar median daily staffing hours, but significant outliers suggest some facilities experience intense demand periods. Organization-owned facilities and those with shorter ownership tenures tend to show higher variability in staffing hours, signaling a need for flexible staffing solutions.

### Recommendations
1. **For Organization-Owned and Shorter-Tenure Facilities**: Emphasize the app’s ability to offer flexible and responsive staffing solutions that can adapt to high demand.
2. **For Longer Tenure Facilities**: Position the app as a tool for improving staffing efficiency and stability.
3. **Educational Resources**: Provide training sessions and educational resources for facility management teams on effectively utilizing the app.
